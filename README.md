Template for papers
===================

This is my personal paper template. I  developed it when writing my
PhD thesis and it has proven useful in many occasions (project proposals,
papers, technical reports etc.)

The `Makefile` copies Latex files from the `latex` directory and figures from
the `figure` directory to the `build` directory, where it runs the `pdflatex`
command. The following transformations are automatically applied to the
figures in order to convert them to PDF files, suitable for use by
`pdflatex`:

* `.eps` files are converted to PDF using the `epstopdf` program
* `.dot` files are converted to PDF using the [Graphiz](http://www.graphviz.org/) program.
* `.dat` files are combined with `.plot` files and fed to [Gnuplot](http://www.gnuplot.info/) 
to produce `.eps` files. Both files must have the same suffix. By convention, 
data are stored in `.dat` files while plotting instructions are stored in `.plot` files.

Bibliography is handled as follows: 

* An `.aux` file is generated by running `pdflatex` on the input file
* If the `.bib` file is supplied by the author in the `latex` directory,
it is used as input.
* Otherwise, the bibliography is collected from a list of `.bib` files
generated by recursively searching the directory specified in the
specified `PAPERPATH`.

If no references exist in the input `.tex` file, the compilation process
will fail.
